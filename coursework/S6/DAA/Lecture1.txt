							Lecture 1 - DAA (Complexity analysis)

Analysis - It is the theorotical estimation of the resource implementation of the particular algorithm.
Predicting the resources that the algorithm requires.

Model of the implementation technology - random - access machine (RAM)
   - Instructions are executed one after another, with no concurrent operations.  
   - The RAM model contains instructions commonly found in real computers:
	-arithmetic(such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, remainder, floor, ceiling), data movement(Load, Store, Copy), and control(Jump instruction).
   - Every instruction takes a constant amount of time.

Analysis criteria (This is not a complete list)
   - Correctness 
   - Readability
   - Simplicity
   - Optimality
   - Amount of space used* - space complexity
   - Amount of work done* - Time complexity
   

Space complexity :-
   - Fixed part
	- Independent of instance characteristics.
   - Variable part
 	- Dependent component variables
 	- Recursion stack space
	
Time complexity :-
   - Amount of computer time it needs to run to completion.
   - Time grows with size of input
   - Time complexity - as a function of input size; T(n)
   - Input size depends on problem.
	- Simple method : Count the number of basic / elementary operations.
